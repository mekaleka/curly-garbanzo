On this homework I definately was overthinking what I needed to do to accomplish the final task. I add comments to what I did. I added a header tag to the header portion of the page at the top. I then added section tags to the main body/sections of the web page. I fixed the link that was broken. I added the aside tag for the elements on the right side of the page but did'nt wrap it properly at first. Finally added the footer tag to wrap the footer element.
