On this homework I definately was overthinking what I needed to do to accomplish the final task... I added comments to what I did. I added a header, section, aside, and footer opening and closing tags as well as manipulated some of the div tags. I fixed the link that was broken and added alt attributes to the image links. When I added the aside tag for the elements on the right side of the page I did'nt wrap it properly at first which caused it to shift down.
